It showed how new cases of cancer could be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray) and thereby provided a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes. These data were used to classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n","# **Content**\n","\n","Golub et al \"Molecular Classification of Cancer: Class Discovery and Class\n","Prediction by Gene Expression Monitoring\"\n","\n","There are two datasets containing the initial (training, 38 samples) and independent (test, 34 samples) datasets used in the paper.
